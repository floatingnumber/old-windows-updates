The games included with Windows 7 don’t work on Windows 8, 8.1 or 10, because
they include some kind of copy protection. Here’s how it is implemented:

All games call

  HRESULT SLGetWindowsInformationDWORD(LPCWSTR *pwszValueName, DWORD *pdwValue)

from slc.dll, with a string like "Shell-InBoxGames-SpiderSolitaire-EnableGame".
On Windows 7, the function then sets *pdwValue to 1 and returns S_OK. On other
Versions of Windows, the function fails or sets *pdwValue to 0.

Fortunately, this not very sophisticated protection is easy to override by
placing a fake slc.dll into the game directory. My fake slc.dll only contains
the SLGetWindowsInformationDWORD() function and that function always sets
*pdwValue to 1 and returns S_OK, regardless of what it was asked to retrieve.

Note that Solitaire, Spider, FreeCell and Hearts also need CardGames.dll
from %SystemRoot%\System32 which is not part of the OS on Windows 8 or later.
